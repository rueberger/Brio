    "In this example we will construct SAILnet (Zylderberg et al, 2011), a simple network for performing sparse inference with local learning rules.\n",

    "SAILnet consists of a single layer of leaky integrate and fire neurons that receive input from a stimulus (an image in this case) and send inhibition to each other. \n",

    "## brio architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "All networks in brio are made out of two elements: Layers and Connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Layer holds state for a population of neurons. Layers can be excitatory, inhibitory or neither. The Layer class does not implement a specific neural model, giving significant wigggle room to subclasses. Implemented sublcasses include neural models for discrete LIF neurons and Boltzmann Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection objects hold state for the weights connecting Layers. By design, Connection objects only have access to information about the Layers they connect, thus the learning rules implemented by Connection subclasses are necessarily local. \n",
    "\n",
    "Network objects hold pointers to the comprising Layers and Connections in addition to global utility methods to train the network and display progress plots.\n",

    "Although brio is primarily an experimental platform and was designed to support arbitrary network topologies with SAILnet-like models, it has significant utility as a general purpose neural network library. \n",

    "To build a network in brio, first instantiate the different layers that are part of the network. \n",
